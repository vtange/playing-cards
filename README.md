# Palace

The Objective: Play out all cards on your hand, then your Upper Palace, then your Secret Palace. Player who first empties out all his/her cards wins

# Setup

Each player gets:

3 Cards in his/her Secret Palace -> Random at start
3 Cards in his/her Upper Palace
	^ Random at start, can be swapped with cards on hand.

3 Cards for his/her hand ^

The Rest goes in a central deck.

# Play

Players put one card from his/her hand into a pile beside the center, draw cards if possible until 3 on hand.

^ Must play a card 'greater' or equal to the card face up.


From weakest to strongest, cards go 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, J, Q, K, Ace, [Magic Cards]

# Magic Cards

Magic Cards can be played over any card, even other Magic Cards. It is often a good idea to always save one on your hand to prevent getting wiped by an enemy Ace or Magic Card.

2 - Must be immediately followed up by the player with another card (Magics are OK too), unless it is the last card played by the player before a win.

7 - Next Player must follow up with a card with a weaker value than 7. (3,4,5, or 6. Magics are OK too).

8 - Functions similar to a 2 but must be followed up by the player with a card greater than 8 (Magics are OK too).

10 - "Blows up" the stack below. Removes itself and all cards below from play so players who wipe thereafter don't end up with a huge hand.
